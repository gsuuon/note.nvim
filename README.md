# note.nvim 📓

A simple Neovim note taking plugin with daily notes, task tracking and syntax highlighting.

## Motivation
note.nvim makes it easy to take working notes and track tasks. It adds commands to help manipulate task items, create daily notes, and navigate within (and between) notes.

## Usage
Write indent-scoped ideas / tasks / notes. You can set a template for daily notes (`:Note`) by creating `[note_root]/.note/daily_template`. You can also add spaces (`config.spaces = { '~', '~/myproject' }`) to set up different note root directories.

Upgrades with some simple OpenAI gpt prompts if [llm.nvim](https://github.com/gsuuon/llm.nvim) is installed.

### Items
A marker indicates their type or status. Indented tasks establish scope and indented properties attach to the outer item. Normal text that are't items will just be ignored by the item commands.

#### Tasks
`>` — current  
`-` — pending  
`.` — done  
`=` — paused  
`,` — cancelled  

#### Properties
`*` — info  
`[` — label  

#### Sections
`#` — section -- Not indented - the number of #'s mean depth like markdown.  

### Modifiers
Some special symbols will also highlight to help with readability:

`->` — flow -- indicates one thing flowing to another  
`<-` — select -- indicates selecting one of a list  
`(?)` — question -- draw attention to something confusing  
`(!)` — warn -- draw attention to something important  

### Links
Links to items can be created with `[(<file>)<marker>|<body>]`. They're just shortcuts that search for a target item, first by searching downwards from the link and then upwards.

`<body>` behaves like a case-insensitive `string.match` against items.

`(<file>)` if present links to that file relative to the current file - the path is joined with the current file's directory. If the file part starts with `/` then the path is resolved relative to the note root.

`<marker>` is a specific marker (e.g. `-`, `*`) or one of these special characters:

`s` — section -- matches any number of #'s  
`p` — property -- matches any property marker  
`t` — task -- matches any task marker  

For example:

`[t|clean]` links to a task containing 'clean'  
`[(chores)s|daily]` links to a file in the same directory as the current file named 'chores' and finds the first section with 'daily'  
`[(/budget)t|groceries]` links to the 'budget' file in the note root and finds the first 'groceries' task  


## Examples
![note](https://github.com/gsuuon/note.nvim/assets/6422188/813e74e7-d9dc-4b5f-b433-4ef294491797)

```
- Take out the trash
  [ chore
```
Here `Take out the trash` is labeled as a `[ chore`.

```
- Cleanup house
  - Wash dishes
  > Pick up toys
```
Here `Pick up toys` is the current (`>`) task and is part of `Cleanup house`.

```
[t|monday]
# Gym
- Monday
  - Squats
[(../health)s|goal]
```
Here `[t|monday]` links to the `- Monday` task and `[(../health)s|goal]` links to the the 'health' file up one directory at a section matching `goal`.
